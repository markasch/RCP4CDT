# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.


We present, step-by-step, the Resource Constrained Process Scheduling---RCPSP---approach for the Continuum Digital Twin---CDT[^1].

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

The basic problem is: find an optimal schedule $S$ for a collection of jobs $J.$^[Inline notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to
type the note, where $J=\{ J_1, J_2, \ldots J_N\}.$]
